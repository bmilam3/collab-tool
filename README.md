Collaboration Matcher for Academics 
This project would be most similar to a dating simulator/game, or a mix between match.com, LinkedIn, and Research Gate. Scholars input research interests & credentials and are then matched to projects that fit their interests. This program would be aimed specifically at multi-disciplinary projects, as it can be difficult for scholars (especially without existing connections) to start an interdisciplinary project. Scholars would be able to post project descriptions and research questions and then tag them for broad searches. Other scholars would be able to search based on these tags to find projects that interest them. They could then view contact information for the original poster to create a connection. I think it would be a little ambitious for me to attempt to add in chat features for in-application connections, at least at this stage in my career. Ideally, I would probably have a partner to bounce ideas off of and split the work load, but I think this could function as a single project if necessary. If this were split between two people, I think it would work best for the work to be split evenly: both partners work on all parts of the plan. This could entail passing the project over during different parts of the work flow.
