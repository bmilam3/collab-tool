# Collaboration Tool for Academics

###### This project would be most similar to a dating simulator/game, or a mix between match.com, LinkedIn, and Research Gate. Scholars input research interests & credentials and are then matched to projects that fit their interests. This program would be aimed specifically at multi-disciplinary projects, as it can be difficult for scholars (especially without existing connections) to start an interdisciplinary project. Scholars would be able to post project descriptions and research questions and then tag them for broad searches. Other scholars would be able to search based on these tags to find projects that interest them. They could then view contact information for the original poster to create a connection.
